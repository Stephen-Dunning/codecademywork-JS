IN this example, the value Sale is set to faslse sso that the else block will operate.

The conditional statement for an if else is always a boolean...... so we only have to test for falsey
or truthiness..... it is not anassignment operator like + or *, it is a bolean, yes/no test....



let sale = true;

sale = false;

if(sale) {
  console.log('Time to buy!');
} else {
  console.log('Time to wait for a sale.');
}
